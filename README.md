## Recommended VS Code Settings ⚙️

💻 To get the most out of Monokai Pirokai, we recommend the following settings:

- **Use a Nerd Font** : Nerd Fonts are a collection of fonts that add additional glyphs to your editor, such as icons for programming languages and tools. We recommend installing a Nerd Font and using it with Neon City for an enhanced coding experience. See [this nerd font repo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for a list of Nerd Fonts.
